ocUsageCharts
=============
ocUsageCharts is created due to the fact that the original usage_charts ( a fork from StorageCharts/ocStorage ) is no longer updated to work properly with owncloud7.

This application is purely designed for owncloud7, it is in first integrated with c3js for rendering charts.

Features
========
- ocUsageCharts stores the disk space used by each user of ownCloud.
- Graphs available:
	- User mode:
		- A pie chart showing space used / free space
		- A graph with data used over the course of time
	- Admin mode
		- A pie chart showing space used by various users
		- A graph with all data used over the course of time

Future ideas
============
Graphs:
	- Files downloaded, or ...
- Option to use alternative for c3js chart rendering.
