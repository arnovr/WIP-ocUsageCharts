The tests are quite bad, this is due to the following reasons:

- Mocking database with owncloud is not possible, forcing to weird code.
- I am using variable dataprovider / adapters, almost impossible to mock. I should refactor that code for the tests
- I dislike writing tests, so i didn't put much effor in it.... :P Maybe in the future ;)
